Compilation_SAm.06NOV2012.IXYEHU.dat = compilation of all 937 points
  Moho thickness for South America (Assumpcao et al., 2013a,b).
 (there are a few repeated stationsâ€¦)
  columns are:
I = Identification (usually station name)
X,Y = long., lat.
E = elevation above msl
H = crustal THICKNESS !!!
    includes topography in continents
    includes ocean layer in oceanic part!
U = uncertainty

other columns are references/observations


model 1:  Seismic constraints (added some gravity-derived controls)

model 3:  Seismic constraints + gravity derived controls + surface-wave tomography
