# Data sets used in the paper

This folder contains the raw and processed data files used in the paper,
plus all synthetic data generated by the Jupyter notebooks in the `code`
folder.

* `south-america-provinces`: the shapefiles outlining the major
  geologic provinces of South America. From
  [Goutorbe et al. (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggv343)
  who adapted from
  [Assumpção et al. (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2012.11.014).
  Downloaded from the Github repository
  [bgoutorbe/seismic-noise-tomography](https://github.com/bgoutorbe/seismic-noise-tomography).
  Also contains the lithospheric plate boundaries from
  [Bird (2003)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001GC000252),
  downloaded from
  [peterbird.name/publications/2003_PB2002/2003_PB2002.htm](http://peterbird.name/publications/2003_PB2002/2003_PB2002.htm)
* `Moho_Map_SAm2013_data.tar.gz` is the seismological Moho depth model and
  point estimates of
  [Assumpção et al. (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2012.11.014),
  provided by the authors.
* `crust1-point-depths.txt`: synthetic point estimates of Moho depth extracted
  from the CRUST1.0 model. Generated by `code/sinthetic-crust1.ipynb`.
* `crust1.0.tar.gz` is the CRUST1.0 model downloaded from
  [igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/crust1.html](http://igppweb.ucsd.edu/~gabi/crust1.html)
* `goco05s-sam-s0.1deg-h50km.gdf` contains the raw gravity data and
  `topography-sam-s0.1deg.gdf` the ETOPO1 topography data, both downloaded from
  the [ICGEM](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/) web service.
* `processed-goco5s-data-sam-h50km.txt`: processed gravity data generated from 
  the GOCO05S data. Includes the gravity disturbance, topographic effect
  calculated using a tesseroid model, topography-corrected (Bouguer) disturbance, 
  gravitational effects of sediments (upper, lower, middle, total),
  sediment- and topography-free disturbance.
  Downsampled to 0.2° grid spacing.

* `synthetic-data-crust1.txt`: Synthetic gravity data for South America 
  generated from the CRUST1.0 model.
  Generated by `code/sinthetic-crust1.ipynb`.
* `synthetic-data-simple.txt`: Synthetic gravity data generated from a
  simple model.
